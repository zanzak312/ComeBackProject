# ComeBackProject
This is the first project of HTML & CSS only markup after long-time break (about 8 months)
Also used SCSS preprocessor.
This was the first experience with Fonts Awesome.
In case you see working sliders, floating scrolling button, working navigation - it means that I also successfully tried to use JS capabilities :)
